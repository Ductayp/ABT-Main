DONE --------------

Gold Star Overhaul
    Rank 3 is no longer required to evolve a stand, you only need to have a full XP bar
    Ranking is now optional, it still uses Gold Stars
    you can use a Gold Star at any time, regardless of your current XP
    Gold Stars shop price increased from 3k to 15k
    Gold Star spawn rates on the main map increased slightly


TODO --------------

Removed Soul Orbs
    Storage unlocked with cash
    no longer need orbs in crafting recipes
    2x Soul Orbs pass converted to 2x Boss Drop pass
    Soul Orbs no longer spawn or drop (obviously)

PvP Toggle Rework
    XP only given when PvP is on (no more 2x XP when it is on)
    this means you gain no XP when PvP is toggled off

Gold Experience
    Started rank system rework (Gold Experiene is the first)


NEXT UPDATE --------------

C-Moon
Dios Crypt Dungeon

Dungeon System Rework
    Dunegns Keys now give timed access to the dungeon that saves when the player leaves
    timer pauses when the player leaves and resumes on re-entry
    you get kicked out when the timer is up
    Player timer will be displayed on the dungeon sign
    Proposal: dungeon sign will also be the way in and out, remove NPCs as gatekeepers
    Proposal: 1 key = 1 Hour on all dunegons
