Stand Rank System Reversion

    - Rolled back the changes to the way it was before
        - need max Xp and 1 Gold Star to rank up

    - Max Xp for each rank is always the same for a stand/spec
        - it used to be different amount on each rank
        - right now its 15k per rank for all stands
        - we want to balance this so give feedback

    - NEW Gold Star crafting recipe: 100 Soul Orbs = 1 Gold Star

    - You can no longer craft Gold Stars from Antidotes

    - You can no longer buy Gold Stars from the shop

    - All mobs including bosses will only drop 1 Soul Orb, but its is garunteed each kill
