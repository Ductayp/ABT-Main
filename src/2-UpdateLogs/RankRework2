Rank Rework 2

    - you need 1 gold star and maxxed out XP to rank up a stand (just like before)

    - XP bar amount is always the same on each rank, but can be different for each stand

    - Gold Stars are craftable with Soul Orbs only (100 orbs = 1 gold star)
        - Antidote no longer used to craft Gold Stars

    - All mobs including bosses to drop only 1 soul orb, garunteed

    - All bosses have a rare chance to drop Gold Stars

    - Double check ItemSpawner gold stars and be sure they are balanced

    - Sell Soul Orbs and Cash in SHOP: now people will need them to buy Gold Stars
