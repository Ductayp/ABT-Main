# Rbx Gui Library

Rbx Gui is a library I created to help developers with a few common UI components that are not currently present on the Roblox platform.

The library is designed around two principles:

1. It should attempt to integrate into standard Roblox Lua UI programming. There are no complex frameworks or big setups, this should feel familiar like using built-in UI objects.

2. The style of the components should be easy to change so that developers can have functionality without having to sacrafice artistic direction. You can edit the default UI objects under the `Defaults` ScreenGui.

Documentation for each class/constructor is in the individual module. You can also see the test place for an example of the components in use.

Currently GuiLib provides support for:

* Checkbox Labels
* RadioButton Groups
* Text Input Masking
* Sliders
* Dropdown Lists
* Scrolling Lists
* Radial Menu
